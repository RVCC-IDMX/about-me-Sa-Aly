My About me Project purpose

In my IDMX class so far i went from not knowing a single word of code or what css even was into making this very site. I learned a lot in a fairly short time which makes me proud of how far this about me project has come. I also have to give thanks for an amazing professor who helped at every step.

For Color scheme: The color scheme i went for for this project was a light green/cyan with hints of true Blue gradients through out the website. The reason I originally went for those colors was due to my avatars green vomit and I kind of just kept it. For all the borders and its shadows i used mainly black but for shadows on some borders I used green or white for text. For background color i kept the background of different sections like hobbies or the contact me form a linear gradient. other cool styles i added were hover effects. I dont think i have even scratched the surface of what i can do with them but i implemented some nice basic hover effects throughout the page. For my photo gallery i just used three pictures that were simple and didnt include my face because i dont think having my face on the internet is a good idea.

The Navbar was a second set of styling to work on the header and adding a responsive nav that links and takes you anywhere throughout the page. I had fun creating and implementing my logo for the navbar as well. Now For the hamburger icon i really struggled to get it completed i only managed to get the main structure in on html and added a close icon. But was unable to actually make it work. I tried watching the first youtube video given in the assignment but got lost on the css parts.

General design: My about me isnt fully complete as i wanted it to be. It does have all the major components and addons that were required but i believe the styling could be a little better in some places. 

Now, for my blog my topic was about the hover effect and how it works. i showcased 2 or 3 effects on the page. In terms of styling my blog i ran into a little issue with the second paragraph not connecting with the other two. However other than that the blog is okay, i used different outside sources cited below for more information and research on the hover effect.

For Citation: I used help from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp to further understand other css code elements that might work better for my About Me. 
For my blog I got my information from https://wpdatatables.com/css-image-hover-effects/#:~:text=Image%20hover%20effects%20create%20an,matter%20how%20many%20you%20add
