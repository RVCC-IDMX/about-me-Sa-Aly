My About me Project purpose

In my IDMX class so far i went from not knowing a single word of code or what css even is into making this very site. I learned a lot in a fairly short time which makes me proud of how far this about me project has come. 

Color scheme: The color scheme i went for for this project was a light green/cyan with hints of true Blue gradients through out the website. The reason I originally went for those colors was due to my avatars green vomit and I kind of just kept it. For all the borders and its shadows i used mainly black but for shadows on some borders I used green. For background color i kept the background of different sections like hobbies or the contact me form a linear gradient.

For Citation: I used help from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp to further understand other css code elements that might work better for my About Me.
