<h2>Image Hover effect</h2>
<div>

    <p>

        Image hover effects is when a User on a webpage interacts with an element using a pointing device such as a mouse, but doesn't exactly activate it. When using image hover effects you can achieve fabulous results on any website with little effort. Hover effects 
        are also one of the most used elements in designing websites. Hover effects are also mainly used to improve visuals and overall user experience when navigating webpages. they also don't clutter designs, and websites tend to run smoothly no matter how many you add. Interactivity is an important part of any modern website,
         as it keeps users engaged and encourages them to spend more time browsing. There's also complex non-css animation that can drag a website down if careless and tend to load slower and add more overhead compared to a hover effect.
         Which is why hover effects are mostly preferable in many cases. 
         Hover effects are usually straightforward and simple most of the time but they can also range from basic to advanced techniques.

    </p>

    There are many hover effects such as Button hover effects, Direction aware hover effect,3d hover effects, css image hover effects, and animation hover effect. 
    Now to successfully create hover effects on css you can start with a link such as "a:hover" which then you can style yourself with different colors, padding, fonts etc. 
    The :hover effect can be used on other things as well and not just links. You can also create links and visisted/unvisited link hovers as well by either using "a:link" or "a:visited".

"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone. And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch.
 I trust your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people 
 who are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to 
 come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me." 4 September.--Zo√∂phagous patient still keeps up our interest in him. He had
  only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid.
   Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, 
   in which state he has remained up to now. The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away. 
   It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum,
    and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly. I cannot quite understand it. Later.
    --Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me
